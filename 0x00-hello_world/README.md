**This is my very first project on C**
#
*0-preprocessor* -  a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
#
*1-compiler* - a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
#
*2-assembler* -  a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
